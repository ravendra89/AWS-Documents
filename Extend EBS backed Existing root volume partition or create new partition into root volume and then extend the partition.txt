@ Extend EBS root volume partition and resize the Filesystem size---
# Determine whether our instance is xen-based or Nitro-based, using below commands-

aws ec2 describe-instance-types --instance-type instance_mentioninstancetpye  --query "InstanceTypes [].Hypervisor"
# Check the Block Devices-
sudo lsblk
# check the Filesystem size-
sudo df -h
# Modifying Your EBS volume on AWS Management Console

but we need to upgrade size what size we need to extend in partition
because in root volume, there is no optition to increase the partition size wise
it will increase the disk partition size what size is available in root volume after upgraded from the console

@ For Nitro-based system--
# Extend the partition
sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1

# now check the partition-
sudo lsblk
#  we need to determine whether the disk use ext3-ext4 or xfs file system:
sudo file -sL /dev/xvda1

# we also need to resize the filesystem to be able to use it:
For ext4 based filesystem type- 
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1
For xfs based filesystem type- 
sudo xfs_growfs /dev/xvda1

# Now check filesystem size
 sudo df -h

Note:- Same above process will be apply in Xen-based system
Note- We can increase any Existing partition of root volume using above process and no need to make filesystem and no need to create mount point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Note-1 we can create new partition in root volume usung below command-
fdisk /dev/xvda  ( xvda is a main root valume name)
then create partition- specify the required size( ex. +5G)- press w to save it
but before this we need to increase volume from console

# crete file system-

mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvda1(new partition)    -----make ext4 based filesystem
or 
mkfs.xfs /dev/xvda1(new partition)    -----make xfs based filesystem
or
sudo mkfs -t ext4 or xfs /dev//xvda1(new partition)
or make forcefully file system-
mkfs.ext4 -f /dev/xvda1

# sudo mkdir /data
# mount the filesystem-
mount /dev/xvda1(new partition) /data   ( data is new directory) this mount point will also be created into root volume
or
# we can also use below step to mount the partition into root volume- but not recommended

mount /dev/xvda1(new partition) /
or
mount /dev/xvda1(new partition) /.
