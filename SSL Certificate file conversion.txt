# File extension	    File type
*.DER or *.CER	             Binary
*.CRT	                     Binary or text
*.PEM	                     Text
*.PFX or *.P12	          Binary


#  Microsoft Windows servers use .pfx files
   Apache servers use .crt, .cer
     Nginx servers use .crt

# Converting certificates between cer/pem/crt/der/pfx/p12 can be done in Linux with the use of OpenSSL tool via the terminal.

These commands allow you to convert certificates and keys to different formats to make them compatible with specific types of servers or software.

Convert a DER file (.crt .cer .der) to PEM

openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem

Convert a PEM file to DER

openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.der

Convert a PKCS#12 file (.pfx .p12) containing a private key and certificates to PEM

openssl pkcs12 -in keyStore.pfx -out keyStore.pem -nodes

You can add -nocerts to only output the private key or add -nokeys to only output the certificates


# How to Convert Your Certificates and Keys to PEM Using OpenSSL
There are four basic ways to manipulate certificates — you can view, transform, combine, or extract them. To transform one type of encoded certificate to another — such as converting CRT to PEM, CER to PEM, and DER to PEM — you’ll want to use the following commands:

OpenSSL: Convert CRT to PEM:
Type the following code into your OpenSSL client:

openssl x509 -in cert.crt -out cert.pem

OpenSSL: Convert CER to PEM
openssl x509 -in cert.cer -out cert.pem

OpenSSL: Convert DER to PEM
openssl x509 -in cert.der -out cert.pem


# Note:- we can also use converter tool from google to conver the file extention
