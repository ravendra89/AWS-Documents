## What is DevOps change management?
  Change management within DevOps is a structured approach for handling change within a development cycle.
These can be modifications, upgrades, or updates that need to be integrated into the software without causing system issues or customer inconvenience.

>> Devops/Cloud environments also provide a variety of automation, integration, and deployment tools that allow the organization to make small, frequent changes
 that reduce business risk and introduce business value at an increased rate. These include solutions such as:

Git
Jenkins
Chef
Puppet
Ansible

>> Why is DevOps change management important?
  Changes management is important because it can 1) improve system performance, functionality, Risk mitigation, stability. 2) Reducing the risk of failures and downtime
3) Enabling continuous improvement

## Change Management in aws cloud
Change Management offers capabilities for tracking changes to AWS resources, defining maintenance windows for changes to systems, 
control specific actions during major events to avoid disruptions, and use automations to perform such change management tasks.
>> Change Manager:-
Change Management is an important part of Operational Excellence. Change Manager is a framework for request, approving, implementing, and reporting 
on operational changes to application configuration and infrastructure. The Change Manager feature allows for use of pre-approved change templates 
to assist in automating change progresses.

>> It's key to remember that all changes should be delivering business value and that change management should be focused on optimizing business risk in a way that maximizes
 productivity while minimizing wasted effort or cost. The AWS Cloud enables automation that optimizes this business risk by:

1) Minimizing the possibility of human error,

2) Enabling the creation of identical environments for predictable and testable outcomes to changes,

3) Removing the requirement to submit changes to scale infrastructure to meet business demand, and

4) Automatically recovering from failure and rolling back failed changes.





## What is IT change management

Change management—also known as change enablement—is an IT practice designed to minimize disruptions to IT services while making changes to critical systems and services. 

A change is adding, modifying, or removing anything that could have a direct or indirect effect on services.
>> Types of changes:-
ITIL defines three types of changes.
1) Standard changes
Standard changes are low-risk, commonly repeated, and pre-approved. They’re performed frequently and follow a documented, approved process. 

For example, adding memory or storage is a standard change. Replacing a failing router with an identical working router is a standard change.
 Creating a new instance of a database is a standard change.
2) Normal changes
Normal changes are non-emergency changes that don’t have a defined, pre-approved process. 

For example, Performance improvements are normal changes, website change. Migrating to a new data center is a normal change.

3) Emergency changes
These changes arise from an unexpected error or threat and need to be addressed immediately—usually to restore service for customers or employees or secure systems against a threat. 

For example, implementing a security patch is an emergency change. Dealing with a server outage is an emergency change. Resolving a major incident is an emergency change.
