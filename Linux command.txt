To mount, in this context, is to make a group of files in a file system structure accessible to a user or user group.
df -hT to chech mount point,( mount point is a disk name that we can create by mkdir /mount name go to mount directory by cd mount /dev/sda1 /mount name.

  /dev/sda2  vg_mylinz lvm2 a-    19.51g      0
  /dev/sdd1  uavg      lvm2 a-   508.00m 408.00m
  /dev/sde   uavg      lvm2 a-   508.00m 508.00m
