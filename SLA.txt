
# SLA ( service-level agreement) is an agreement between a service provider and a customer

This agreement provides all the information and details regarding the products and services that the service provider must provide to their customers or clients. 
SLA also provides the basis on which services can be measured and whether the expectation of the client has been met or not.


1) Customer-level SLA

A customer-based SLA is an agreement that covers all of the services used by a customer. 
A customer service level agreement covers specific details of services, provisions of service availability,
 an outline of responsibilities, escalation procedures, and terms for cancellation.

2) service-level agreement-

A service-level agreement defines the level of service you expect from a vendor.

3) Multi-level SLA

This type of agreement is split into multiple levels that integrate several conditions into the same system. 
This approach is suitable for providers that have many customers using their product at different price ranges or service levels. 
These differing service levels can be built into a multi-level SLA.
