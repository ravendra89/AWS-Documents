# how do i troubleshoot if ec2 instance is not responding.....

AWS EC2 server becomes unresponsive due to several reasons. We need to know the scenarios to handle it properly.

1) An AWS EC2 server becomes unresponsive when the load is more than 100% for a very long time.
 It can happen because of the abnormality in the app/database/web services you deployed on the AWS EC2 server. You cannot connect to AWS EC2 server via SSH during this time.

>> Go to AWS EC2 management console and try rebooting the server, If a reboot didn't work, try stopping the AWS EC2 server and wait for some time. Then, try starting it again.
 It is the only way to bring back an overloaded AWS EC2 server to online.

2) IF our ec2 instance are running on default tenancy hardware then Mostly, Due to hardware failure, 
AWS migrates our EC2 virtual machine server from one hardware rack to another without notifying you.
 The AWS EC2 server becomes unresponsive (5-10 minutes) on that time and then comes back online. Sometimes, it won't come back online at all.
 we can do nothing about it, but we can contact AWS customer support for the solution.


# Troubleshoot instance launch issues---
Invalid device name
Instance limit exceeded
Insufficient instance capacity
The requested configuration is currently not supported.
Insufficient permissions

# Connection problems and errors with ec2 instance----
@ Common causes for connection issues..............
1) Verify and use correct username for your instance
2) Verify that our security group rules allow traffic
3) Verify that  instance is ready--
   Verify the following:
In the Instance state column, verify that your instance is in the running state.
In the Status check column, verify that your instance has passed the two status checks.

@ Error connecting to our instance: Connection timed out---

1) Check  security group rules.
2) Check the route table for the subnet.
3) Check the network access control list (ACL) for the subnet.
4) Check the CPU load on your instance; the server may be overloaded.

@ Error: Unprotected private key file----
 private key file must be protected from read and write operations from any other users. 
If our private key can be read or written by anyone  then SSH ignores our key and we see the Unprotected private key file error--

note:- private key .ssh/my_private_key.pem with file permissions of 777, which allow anyone to read or write to this file. 
This permission level is very insecure, and so SSH ignores this key.

>> If you are connecting from macOS or Linux, run the following command to fix this error, substituting the path for your private key file.

 chmod 400 .ssh/my_private_key.pem



# host key not found during connecting an instance--
reason--
1) private key is not correct
2) specifying server user name is wrong
