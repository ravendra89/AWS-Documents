# Using AWS Backup, you can copy backups to multiple AWS Regions on demand or automatically as part of a scheduled backup plan. 
Cross-Region replication is particularly valuable if you have business continuity or compliance requirements to store backups a minimum distance away from your production data.

# Amazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region to increase the scalability.  

#  Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby instance in a different AZ.
