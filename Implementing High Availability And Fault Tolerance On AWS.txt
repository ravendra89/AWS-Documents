# Implementing High Availability And Fault Tolerance On AWS---
@ Below services provide High Availability And Fault Tolerance in AWS:

1) Auto-scaling: With the help of this service, computing resources can be automatically scaled to meet demand. 
   It makes sure that your apps always have the resources they need, altering capacity to handle different workloads.

2) Elastic Load Balancing: When it comes to dividing up incoming application traffic among several targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances or containers, ELB is essential. 
   Scalability and fault tolerance are improved by ELB's equitable traffic distribution, which keeps no single instance or resource from overloading. 

3) Amazon RDS Multi-AZ (Availability Zone): Multi-AZ deployments, which automatically replicate databases across various availability zones, 
are a feature of Amazon Relational Database Service. By offering redundancy and failover support, this feature improves HA.
 RDS minimizes disruptions and guarantees ongoing database availability in the case of a primary database failure by smoothly switching to a standby replica.

4) Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Amazon S3 makes a substantial contribution to both HA and FT with its highly available storage solution.
 By duplicating data across several locations within a region, guarding against potential hardware failures, and offering reliable data access, it assures data durability and availability.

5) Amazon Route 53: Route 53 is a scalable and dependable domain name system (DNS) that is essential to providing applications with high availability and fault tolerance. 
It successfully directs end-user requests to the endpoints that are most available, enabling a seamless user experience even in the event of infrastructure outages.

6) Amazon CloudWatch for extensive monitoring and alerting.

# Implementing High Availability And Fault Tolerance Strategies On Ec2 instance--

1. Launch EC2 Instances:
Launch EC2 instances across several Availability Zones (AZs). Make sure your web application is hosted on instances that have the same configuration.
Set up security groups to permit incoming connections to the web server instances on ports 80 or 443 (HTTP/HTTPS).
2. Elastic Load Balancer:
 Establish an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and set it up such that incoming traffic is split among your EC2 instances.
 Configure your EC2 instances' health checks with the ELB. This guarantees that traffic is only routed to healthy instances.
3. Database Setup with Amazon RDS:
To provide database redundancy across many AZs, create an Amazon RDS instance (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) in Multi-AZ deployment mode.
Set up backups, security groups, and database options based on the needs of your application.
4. Implement Auto Scaling:
  Create Auto Scaling groups for your Amazon EC2 instances. This enables automatic scaling to manage different workloads based on predetermined triggers (e.g., CPU use, traffic).
  Define scaling policies to dynamically add or delete EC2 instances as demand changes.
