@ To check complete information of the server-
cat /root/supporthelp/serverinfo-13042022
@ fdisk -l/sfdisk -l  to check disk partition.

@ . Using ncdu
Another CLI-based tool you can use to check the disk usage in Linux is ncdu. Unlike df,
 ncdu is not installed in most Linux distributions by default. If you use a Debian-based distro, 
you can install this tool by typing the following command (I use Ubuntu in this case).

$ sudo apt install ncdu

@ df 
through df tool we can check the disk usage


# cat /etc/os-release  to check os version
# uname -r             to check Linux kernel version
# hostname -i/I     TO check server ip

@ type "hostname"  to check server hostname/VM name
or
hostnamectl
or
cat /proc/sys/kernel/hostname

postgres -V          to check database

OR
psql -V            TO CHECK DB VERSION AND NAME ( important)
## lsblk  to check disk partition
## check linux port enable/listen or unconn/disable------

 sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN    To check only (list open ports) listening/enable port.

sudo ss -tulw  to check complete port status
or
sudo ss -tulwn
# ipconfig /all to check dns information( physical address is dns)
## check latency-
traceroute ip port
or 
ping ip enter

##  netstat -an to check to see which ports are listening.
or
# netstat -nltup to check enabled port
or
#  netstat -ap | grep http/https/(80/443) important

##### Use ss command to display all open TCP and UDP ports in Linux.
             OR
#### use the netstat command to list all ports in Linux.
## To see the domain part of the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name), enter:

### SERVER KA LOAD HIGH HO RHA MEANS CPU KA USE MAXIMUM HO RHA.


### what is Linux Server Load.?
Linux Server Load refers to the average work being done by a web server in a given amount of time. 
It is generally specified in averages of the last 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 15 minutes.
## A higher average server load means that the CPU is being used more, and obviously, access to the server is slow. Apart from this, 
the memory usage of the system is also considered when server load is being referred to.
 A server system that runs out of memory can result in its shutdown.

####  uptime--- Check Linux Server Load Using Uptime Command----
The main purpose of the uptime command in Linux is to show how long the system has been on, i.e., 
the time elapsed since the last boot. However, it also gives a very quick overview of the load on the system.
output--the load averages, 0.06, 0.03, and 0.00.
As mentioned before these are three averages for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes. They show the percentage of CPU used in those durations.

Hence, 0.06 means 6% average use of CPU in the last minute, 0.03 means 3% average use of CPU in the last 5 minutes.
 0% average use of CPU signifies extremely less use over the span of 15 minutes, which can often be the case if the system is kept in suspend mode.

@ Linux patch management-
 Linux patch management is the process of managing patches for applications running on Linux computers.
