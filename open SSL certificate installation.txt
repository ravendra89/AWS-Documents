Step 1: Update Your Server


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

Step 2: Install mod_ssl
The next step is to install the mod_ssl module. This can be done using the following command:

sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-ssl

This command will install the mod_ssl module along with its dependencies.

Step 3: Enable mod_ssl
After the installation is complete, you need to enable the mod_ssl module. This can be done using the following command:

sudo a2enmod ssl

Step 4: Set Up SSL Certificate

Once the mod_ssl module is enabled, the next step is to set up an SSL certificate. 
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will create a self-signed certificate.
This type of certificate is fine for testing purposes or for internal use, but for a public website, you should consider getting a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority.

You can create a self-signed certificate using the openssl command as follows:

sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt

Note:- replace selfsigned name and mention the name as our choice

This command will create a new RSA key and a self-signed certificate valid for 365 days. 
The key will be stored in the file /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key and the certificate in the file /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt.

Step 5: Configure Apache to Use SSL

First, open the file with a text editor. In this example, weâ€™ll use nano:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
In this file, look for the lines that start with SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile. Replace them with the following lines:

SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key

Step 6: Enable the SSL Site
The next step is to enable the SSL site. This can be done using the a2ensite command as follows:
sudo a2ensite default-ssl
Step 7: Restart Apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2
