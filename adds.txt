## ADDS(Active directory domain services)- 
* ADDS is a role,  we can use ADDS to manage complete  server environment with the  help of domain. 
In adds feature one domain provide service to multiple network or server.
OR
# Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) are the core functions in Active Directory that manage users and computers and allow sysadmins to organize
the data into logical hierarchies. AD DS provides for security certificates, Single Sign-On (SSO), LDAP, and rights management.
## ADDS Component---
1- physical component-
* Data store
* Domain controllers
* Global catalog server
* RODC
2- Logical component-
* partitions
* schema
* Domains
* Domain trees
* Forests
* sites
* OUs
## The Active directory schema acts as a blueprints for ADDS by defining the attributes and object classes such as-
NOTE- Means i can do below configuration.

ATTRIBUTES                          CLASSES
* objectSID                        * USER
* LOCATION                         * GROUP 
* MANAGER                          * COMPUTER
* DEPARTMENT                       * SITE

## GLOBAL CATALOG SERVER-
Global catalog create repository file, global catalog hosts a partial attribute set for other domains in the forest supports queries for objects
throughout the forest.
## DC( domain controller)-it is a root domain.
## CDC(Child domain controller)- it is a backup server of main server.
## GCDC( Grand child domain controller)-it is a member server of CDC.
## ADC(Additional domain controller)- it is a coppy of main/root server.
## RODC(Read only domain controller)- IN RODC server we can only read informtion of any server.
## FOREST DOMAIN- It is a combination of complete server such as- DC,CDC,GCDC,ADC,RODC.

## ADDS INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS SERVER 2016--( Configure our domain on windows server).
* firstly configure ip on server- control panel-network and internet-network and sharing center-change adapter settings-then iv4 and configure ip.
note- (ip, gateway and dns will be same)
 Open server manager-manage-add role and features-next-role based or features based installation-next-select a server from the server pool-next-
select server roles(adds)- add features-next-next-next-click on restart the destination server automatically if required-install-
close-click on flag-click on promote this server to a domain controller-first option for ADC AND RODC, SECOND OPTION FOR CDC AND GCDC AND THIRD OPTION FOR
NEW SERVER ESTABLISH- MENTION OUR DOMAIN IN THE BOX( globally unic name hota h  we can say FQDN) means we can register our domain in the windows server- 
next- mention password-next-next-next-next-next-install.
## NOW CREARE CDCOR GCDC OR ADS OR RODC ---
* firstly configure ip on server- control panel-network and internet-network and sharing center-change adapter settings-then iv4 and configure ip.

next-click on windows server technical preview- then select server for CDC on both box- mention password-next-next-next-next-next-install-tool-DNS-

allow on both nonsecure and secure dynamic updates-next-finish- now click on reverse lookup zones-click on  first file (0.0.10.in-addr-click on new PTR-
CLICK ON FORWORD OF TWO TIMES- open our domain name-select our computer( server name)-ok- ip resolved on uper side- now verify DNS is working or not-
open cmd - type nslookup ip/domain name and check( if everything is right then dns is working- now open other server -
congigure ip( gateway adds(DC) servOTHer ka dena h same for DNS)-now open CMD and ping with adds server IP- if not reachable then off the firewall on both server-
now click on machine-network-adapter-select bridge adapter or host only adapter( if both side is virtual box) on both server- now both server show the reply.

                                         ## BOTH SERVER ARE CONNECTED ##

## Now make CDC OR ADS OR RODC OR GCDC WHAT EVER I WANT---
Open other server 2008,2012 etc. (jis par configure karna h)-server manager-role-add role- next- select adds-click on add required features-next-
next-install-close-click on adds- run the adds-next-next-select any one fOR ADS,CDC,GCDC( FOR ADS OR RODC SELECT FIRST AND FOR CDC AND GCDC SELECT SECOND-
Next-type domain name-click on set- now dc server ki details mention karni h like domain name/administrator then password-ok-next- click on browse- select domain name-
now type name according to me( its for cdc and gcdc)- next- next-next- ( ADS AND RODC ME NAME NAHI DENA PADTA)agar mai click nhi karunga to ADS banega- 
if rodc me click karunga to rodc banega-next- now mention password (same server ka password)-next-click on reboot box-next- now we can check completed.
## now dc server se ham control kar sakte h other server ko jisme configuration kiya h-- means dc server se user create kar sakta hu other server me-
## how to create user-
open DC server - server manager- tool-active directort user and computers-click on domain name- change domain-browse-click on domain and select our 
created( ADS OR RODC OR CDC-GCDC SERVER)-ok- now open our created server-click on user and create the user--
Now check-
open other server- active directory user and computers-open our created server-user- and check created user.
