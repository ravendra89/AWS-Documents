## WHAT IS IOPS----
@ Input/output operations per second (IOPS, pronounced eye-ops) is an input/output performance measurement used to characterize computer storage devices 
like hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD), and storage area networks (SAN).
OR
@ Disk I/O includes read or write or input/output operations( defined in KB/s) involving a physical disk.
In simple words, it is the speed with which the data transfer task place between the hard disk and RAM, or basically it measure active disk I/O Time.

## For linux---
## below command to check IOPS status----

@ iostat. iostat can be used to report the disk read/write rates and counts for an interval continuously. …
@ iotop. iotop is a top-like utility for displaying real-time disk activity. …
@ dstat. dstat is a little more user-friendly version of iostat , and can show much more information than just disk bandwidth. …
@ atop. …
@ ioping
