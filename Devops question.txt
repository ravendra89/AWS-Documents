# GIT QUESTION- What are the steps to unstage files and discard changes in the working directory
To unstage a file(which is not yet committed but in staging stage); command 'git reset <file-name>'  is used. After using 'git reset HEAD myfile.txt' command; 'git status' command won't show myfile.txt within the list of files unfinished to commit, currently it'll be displayed below the list of the unstage/untracked files.

Now to discard the changes('myfile.txt') in working directory; command 'git checkout -- <file-name>' is used. After using 'git checkout -- myfile.txt' command; 
'git status' command will not show myfile.txt in the list of unstage/untracked files as this file 'myfile.txt' will be replaced with the last committed version from the repository.

# What are the real time challenges faced while working with git jenkins docker and ansible in our project

It depends on your use case. How we are using the tools, it depends on that. It is not like that some challenges are fixed.
 When we work on a real project, then we may face some problems. Then we try to find a solution on how to solve the issue. 
For example, in automation, we can perform a task in a simple Jenkins job. But in some use cases, we need to use Pipeline.

# CI CD Build failure in production, why ?
we check logs/console out put and resolve the issue but if we don't have permission to check the log then we can tell below given reason-

1) might be production server is down

2) production server is getting update

solution- we can perform monthly update--os patching
3) might be deployed wrong git branch

4) might be developement, QA, testing, production server are not in same configuration



# Can Jenkins run several jobs in the same time?
Yes it's possible. Doc: If this option is checked, 
Jenkins will schedule and execute multiple builds concurrently (provided that you have sufficient executors and incoming build requests).
