
What is upstream and downstream service in a microservices based architecture such as Kubernetes:- 
 
I already know that upstream services are those that do not depend on any other services and downstream services depend on the upstream services.
 For example, the front-end would be a downstream service to the backend as it depends on it.                                                                
 The services that provide data or functionality to other services are referred to as “upstream” services, 
 while the services that consume data or functionality from other services are called “downstream”
