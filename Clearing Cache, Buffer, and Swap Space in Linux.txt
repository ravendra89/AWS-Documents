Memory cache is a component of the systemâ€™s RAM that stores frequently accessed data, allowing for faster retrieval and reduced load times. When a program or file is accessed, 
the system checks the cache before retrieving data from the slower storage devices like hard drives or SSDs. This process improves overall system performance and responsiveness.

However, as time goes by, the cache can become filled with unnecessary or outdated data, leading to reduced system efficiency. 
In such cases, clearing the memory cache can help regain lost performance.


Cached memory is memory that Linux uses for disk caching. However, this doesn't count as "used" memory, since it will be freed when applications require it.
 Hence you don't have to worry if a large amount is being used.        



# free -h   to check memory space

# To clear PageCache only, run the following commands in the terminal:
sudo sync && echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches 
or
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >  /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'

                                                                                          
#  To clear dentries and inodes only, run the following commands in the terminal:

sudo sync && echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches   

or

sudo sh -c 'echo 2 >  /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'   



# Clear Dentries, Inodes, and PageCache:

sudo sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches 

or

sudo sh -c 'echo 3 >  /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'  







@ Shared memory is used to share the same resources between multiple processes.


@ Swap memory-
Swap is a space on a disk (it is located on disk) that is used when the amount of physical RAM memory is full.



# To clear swap space, you can use the swapoff command with the -a option, which will disable all swap partitions.

sudo swapoff -a
# Then, turn it back by running the following command, which will activate all swap partitions.

sudo swapon -a
